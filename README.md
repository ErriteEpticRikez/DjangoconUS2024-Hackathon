## Goals

- Create a platform for artists to share their art with the world, where the focus is on the art and not the artist.

## Infrastructure

- Flutter for the front end
- Django for the backend
- Postgres for the database
- Platform.sh for hosting
- GitHub for version control
- Slack for communication

## Implementation

- Comments are anonymized. Only the artist can see who commented.
- Images are shown 5 at a time, and the next 5 are preloaded in the background.
- The only algorithms for viewing art are *chronological* and *random*. The goal is to give all artists an equal chance to be seen.
- Option to upload art in either portrait or landscape orientation.
- Ability to create collections of art.
- Moderation tools and reporting for the artist, and for reporting artwork that violates the terms of service.
